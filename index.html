      <p class="content-subtitle">It felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow. Like it had pulled it on, the way you pull on a sweater. 
      <br>Next to the train line, footprints were sunken to their shins. Trees wore blankets of ice.</br>
      <br>As you might expect, someone had died.</br></p>

      <p class="content-subtitle">The heat was still strong enough to warm her when she stood at the foot of the ash heap. 
        <br>When she reached her hand in, she was bitten, but on the second attempt, she made sure she was fast enough.</br>

<br>Alex and Barbara Steiner would not disclose what was said while the dominoes were falling like dead bodies in the living room. </br>
<br>If only Rudy had kept listening at the door, just for another few minutes . . .</br>
<br>He told himself in the weeks to come or in fact, pleaded with himself that if he had heard
the rest of the conversation that night, hed have entered the kitchen much earlier.</br>
<br>I'll go, he'd have said. Please, take me, Im ready now.</br>

If he'd intervened, it might have changed everything.</p>
